/exports-undefined-when-trying-to-bundle-a-typescript-library-with-webpack

sol:
In webpack.config.js:

output: {
  ...
  libraryTarget: 'umd',
  library: 'MyPackageName',
  ...
}

/react-createelement-type-is-invalid-expected-a-string

sol:
used the component as {function()} call instead of
<Component/> inside the render

___________________________


new lesson learnt: webpack chunks are not meant to be used in the library
because it will conflict with the output.publicPath configuration when
used in the project.
